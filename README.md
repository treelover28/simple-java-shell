# simple-java-shell
A simple Shell implemented in Java using a Linked-Tree structure
Project for COMP 2673 at University of Denver
For viewing and learning purposes only. PLEASE DON'T COPY MY CODE :'(

Include basic Shell commands like:
	pwd,
	cd (only include cd .. and cd <directory_name_in_pwd>),
	ls,
	mkdir,
	touch,
	rm,
	rmdir,
	tree,
	quit,
	
If unknown command is type, shell basically does nothing.
Save current Filesystem to a file called "fs.data" after user type 'quit' into the console
